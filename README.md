# Project
My first data analysis project

Data source - https://www.kaggle.com/jessemostipak/hotel-booking-demand

I tried to analyse the revenue distribution between the hotel types, average adr, busiest months, months with lowest adr etc. 

I have also created a visual on power BI and here's the link to pdf ( I know.. I didn't know any other way to put up .pbix file)
